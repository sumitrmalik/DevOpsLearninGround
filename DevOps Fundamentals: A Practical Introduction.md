## Traditional vs DevOps

### Traditional
In the traditional software development lifecycle, the process is segmented between two distinct teams:

- **Development Team**:
    - Gathers business requirements
    - Develops the application code
    - Stores the code in a centralized repository (e.g., GitHub)
    - Notifies the Operations team upon completion

- **Operations Team**:
    - Retrieves the code from the centralized repository
    - Performs manual testing
    - Deploys the application to the server

### Key Characteristics of the Traditional Approach:
- Separation of roles: Development and Operations teams function independently, leading to potential communication gaps and slower workflows.
- Development Team: Focused solely on coding, with little involvement in deployment or operational concerns.
- Operations Team: Responsible for ensuring the application is tested and deployed, often involving manual processes.

### How Does the Traditional Model Work?
The development team completes the coding phase and stores the code in a central repository. Once finished, they inform the operations team (usually via email or another non-automated method). The operations team then downloads the code, manually tests it, and handles deployment to the server. This siloed structure often results in delays, miscommunications, and inefficiencies, as the two teams work in isolation from one another.

### Disadvantages of the Traditional Approach

- Manual processes: Tasks like testing and deployment are labor-intensive, which increases the time required to complete each phase.
- Higher risk of errors: The reliance on manual intervention makes the process prone to human errors, which can affect the quality and reliability of the application.
- Extended Time to Market (TTM): The slower, segmented workflow makes it difficult to quickly release new features or updates, making the model less suitable for companies needing agility and rapid growth.

### DevOps

- DevOps Team:
    - Gathers business requirements
    - Develops application code
    - Stores code in GitHub
    - Automates testing
    - Deploys the application to the serve

- Integrated Approach:
    DevOps merges development and operations into a unified team responsible for both application development and deployment.

#### How DevOps Works?

DevOps is a methodology that fosters collaboration between development and operations, allowing the team to develop, test, and deploy applications faster and with fewer bugs. By automating various processes, such as testing and deployment, DevOps ensures a streamlined workflow, reducing bottlenecks and improving efficiency.

#### Advantages of DevOps

- Automated Processes: Automation reduces the time spent on manual tasks.
- Fewer Errors: Automation minimizes the risk of human error, improving application reliability.
- Faster Time to Market (TTM): DevOps accelerates development and deployment, making it ideal for fast-paced, growing companies.

#### Popular DevOps Tools

- Git: Version control system for tracking code changes.
- Jenkins: Continuous integration tool for automating code build, testing, and deployment.
- Docker: Containerization tool for packaging and deploying applications in isolated environments.
- Kubernetes: Orchestration tool for managing and scaling containerized applications.
- Ansible: Configuration management tool for automating setup and configuration tasks.
- Terraform: Infrastructure-as-code tool for automating infrastructure provisioning.
- Monitoring Tools: Tools like Grafana, Prometheus, and Nagios for monitoring applications and infrastructure.
